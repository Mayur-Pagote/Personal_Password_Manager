# Personal_Password_Manager
This is my second project, a personal password manager. 
We know that when login details are saved in Google, anyone using the same PC can access websites using those saved credentials without authorization, which can lead to data breaches. 
To avoid this, I have created a personal password manager using Python that utilizes the OS library, Pickle library, and EasyGUI library. 
In this project, you can read, write, and delete login details, all while only needing to remember one master username and password.
